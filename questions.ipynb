    "It is easy to cause gradient vanishing, since when requesting contribution of gradient of each layer to the final outcome, each gradient of weight will multiply gradients of layers after it, and approach to zero if some of gradients after it are small. As a result, any of activation function that have a range of points on which the gradient is approaching to zero will have difficulty on gradient base learning in hidden layer.\n",

    "For multi-layer neuron network,Same weight variance between each layer can increase the convergence speed. Therefore when initialising weight, it would be better if weights between different layers have a standard weight variance. Therefore, after initialising weight of first layer, we can use its variance as standard to initialise the rest of weights.\n"
